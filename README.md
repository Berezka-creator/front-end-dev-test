# front-end-dev-test

## Intro

Congratulations on making it to the testing phase of the hiring process! For this part of the hiring process we would like to see your creativity, how well you code, and how well you follow instructions.

Some key things you will need to know before you start is how to run a local server and how to connect your markup to your scripts and styles. For this project we have supplied a server and a promise based HTTP client dependency for you to use. We use axios but feel free if you make it to the api section to use any dependency you want.

## Instructions

The goal of this project is to create a client website that has some key features requested by the client (ie. us as the client). Since we are a dev shop that primarily works in the healthcare orthodontic industry we would like the focus of the project to be based on ortho features.

Please clone this repo and submit a link to the new project's repo along with any instructions about how to see the final product. You do not need to host this project anywhere but it would be nice to see via a link instead of having to run the build locally.
