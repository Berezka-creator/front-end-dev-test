# front-end-dev-test

## Intro

Congratulations on making it to the testing phase of the hiring process! For this part of the hiring process, we would like to learn about your creativity, how well you code, and how well you follow instructions.

You will need to have knowledge of some key things before you start:
  - how to run a local server and
  - how to connect your markup to your scripts and styles
  - front end web development

For this project, we have supplied a server and some development dependencies feel free to use any (you can find these in the package json). You do not have to run the local server but feel free to use it, we have configured a simple one for you. The dev server has hot reloading for your html, styles, and scripts. Commands are pretty simple, if you choose to use our server we supplied you can use the commands below in your terminal:

<pre>
  npm install
  npm start
</pre>

<em>NOTE: You will need node and npm on your machine if you choose to use the supplied server, also for hosting you will need to set up yourself.</em>

## Instructions

The goal of this project is to create a client website that has some key features requested by the client (i.e. Rooster Grin as the client). Since we are a dev shop that primarily works in the healthcare/orthodontic industry, we would like the focus of the project to be based on orthodontic features.

Please clone this repo and submit a link to the new project's repo along with any instructions for viewing the final product. It is not required to host this project anywhere, but it would be nice to view your project via a link rather than having to run the build locally.

Your wireframes can be found in the wireframes folder and the assets are in the assets can be found here: <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/sh/2bd0je35gba1gb0/AAC6Px9SU_UPjMWmQlx9on4oa?dl=0">https://www.dropbox.com/sh/2bd0je35gba1gb0/AAC6Px9SU_UPjMWmQlx9on4oa?dl=0</a>
